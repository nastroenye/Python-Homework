# Python Assignments First-Year Portfolio

This repository contains my first two years of Python coursework: small interactive programs, practice exercises, and mini-projects covering core programming concepts. Each script focuses on a different topic such as NumPy, OOP, file handling, user input, API usage, and basic data structures.
I am still learning, but I hope this collection shows my growing progress and understanding of Python.

## Topics

Across all scripts, the following concepts are practiced:
* Variables, loops, conditions
* Functions and modules
* Object-oriented programming (classes/objects)
* File handling and saving data
* Input validation and menus
* NumPy array manipulation
* Basic API requests and error handling
* Working with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
* Creating and using own modules and packages

## Libraries

No special setup needed for most scripts. Only one program requires installation.

```sh
pip install requests
